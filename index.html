      <div class="dev hidden">
          <p>I started my developing journey at the dawn of 2024. I'm currently completing 
            Codecademy's Front-End Engineer path and I'm super excited to begin working as a Front-End Developer!

      <div class="mus hidden">
          <p>I am an active electric guitarist.
            I am in a band called Void Era with whom we rock heavily.
            I am also a singer/songwriter.
            My favorite band is the Red Hot Chilli Peppers (and John Frusciante of course!),
            and I love funk music!
            Let me know who's your favorite artist!
          </p>
      </div>
      <li id="therapy">Therapy</li>
      <div class="ther hidden">
          <p>My basic proffession (prior to Development) is Physiotherapy. 
            I have an MSc in Advanced Physiotherapy, and I am really good at it.
            My true love although in the whole therapeutic procedure is Psychology, 
            so, lately, I'm digging into these territories as well.
            You can share your passion with me!
            I would love to chat about it!
